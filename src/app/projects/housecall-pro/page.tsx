            In the summer of 2024, I interned at Housecall Pro, a B2B SaaS
            company that provides software solutions for small and medium-sized
            home service businesses. I designed an end-to-end product that
            seamlessly integrated e-signature collection and storage within the
            estimates feature, enhancing credibility by ensuring compliance with
            the E-Sign Act and implementing legally binding elements.
            <br />
            <br />
            Additionally, I built design components for a smooth integration of
            e-signatures into other areas of the software.

          PROBLEM: WHY DO WE NEED A LEGAL SIGNATURE?

        <p className="text-base">
          Pros cannot collect homeowners signature and gain approval for work
          when sending an estimate remotely. This lack of clear, legally binding
          signatures on estimates and other critical documents means Pros have
          poorer evidence of the approval when facing legal disputes or having
          other types of misunderstandings with their customers.
