            InternConnect is an online community platform designed to help
            computer science students navigate the challenging process of
            securing internships.
            <br />
            <br />
            As part of our CS 160 project, we were tasked with identifying a
            community and addressing a common struggle. We chose to create a
            <strong>centralized, forum-styled platform</strong> that{" "}
            <strong>simplifies internship preparation</strong> by connecting
            students with opportunities, mentors, and resources â€” empowering
            them to confidently launch their careers in tech.

          Our computer science internship community website was born from our
          own personal struggles and a solid understanding of the challenges
          that computer science students encounter in their journey. We
          identified the need for a platform that not only enhances technical
          learning but also nurtures a collaborative and inclusive community. I
          learned how to communicate designs to engineers and creating a design
          system to streamline the implementation process!
