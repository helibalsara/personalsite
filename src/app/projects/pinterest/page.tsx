            Pinterest is a social media platform dedicated to providing
            motivation and inspiration to all,{" "}

            They challenged Berkeley Innovation, a student-run design
            consultancy, to{" "}

              improve their simple three-step ad creation process for
              small-medium businesses.

            As the Synthesis lead for this project, I guided the team to
            finalize contextual inquiries and unify research insights through
            affinity and journey mapping.

                With the current design, if a business has many pins, it can be
                a <strong>hassle finding the one they want to promote.</strong>{" "}
                To better organize this, we separated two views of pins into
                recents and boards. This allows users to{" "}
                <strong>easily find the pin and help them save time.</strong>

                Many users thought the UI was too ‚Äú
                <strong>white and plain</strong>‚Äù and certain elements could
                stand out. We enhanced the card format so active section is
                dynamically highlighted. We also changed the ‚ÄúPromote‚Äù button to
                red to help it stand out. We included a pop-up{" "}
                <strong>confirmation</strong> once the pin is promoted with
                links to resources helping new users.
