            I was definitely intimidated to tackle this semester-long project,
            but it was an amazing experience working with real clients. Working
            with Pinterest taught me how to effectively leverage contextual
            inquiries to understand user flows and drive research-backed
            insights further into the creation phase.

            I&apos;d like to extend a huge thank you to Judy and Wei from
            Pinterest for guiding and supporting our team all semester, as well
            as to the rest of my team for pulling through this exciting journey!
