            This was the design challenge portion of my application in Berkeley
            Innovation. We had <strong>5 days</strong> to solve a given HMW
            statement and this challenge was focused on a college student&apos;s
            learning experience. There are a myriad of ways we learn and engage
            with course content. However, many find the current learning process
            disengaging and unaccommodating to each individual student&apos;s
            needs.
            <br />
            How might we improve a college student&apos;s{" "}

          It was important break down this broad HMW statement, so I
          brainstormed what were things I struggled with personally to hone in
          on a particular area. Staying focused and engaged in class throughout
          the semester were my struggle areas. I researched these topics and
          used the insights to create a user survey. I did some desktop research
          around these topics and gathered some insights to create a user
          survey.

          I focused this survey on engagement with class material and their time
          spent into learning and understanding content. 66.7% students selected
          that they strongly/disagree with the statement that they engage with
          content inside the classroom. Most students engage with class content
          outside of class

          Why was there was such a large difference in engagement levels inside
          and outside of class? I conducted 4 30-minute interviews with
          students, one from each graduating class and found 3 main pain points.
