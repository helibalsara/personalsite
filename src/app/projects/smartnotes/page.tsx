            This was the design challenge portion of my application in Berkeley
            Innovation. We had <strong>5 days</strong> to solve a given HMW
            statement and this challenge was focused on a college student&apos;s
            learning experience. There are a myriad of ways we learn and engage
            with course content. However, many find the current learning process
            disengaging and unaccommodating to each individual student&apos;s
            needs.

          It was important break down this broad HMW statement, so I
          brainstormed what were things I struggled with personally to hone in
          on a particular area. Staying focused and engaged in class throughout
          the semester were my struggle areas. I researched these topics and
          used the insights to create a user survey. I did some desktop research
          around these topics and gathered some insights to create a user
          survey.

          spent into learning and understanding content. 66.7% students selected

          content inside the classroom. Most students engage with class content
          outside of class.

            SmartNotes is an AI-powered pen concept designed to help college
            students review for exams more efficiently. It features a microphone
            and speaker to record lectures and relay synthesized notes. The tool
            can distill information into either a broad overview or a detailed
            explanation, tailored to the user&apos;s needs. Additionally, a hand
            grip sensor vibrates when it detects students losing focus in class.
            SmartNotes can function as both a traditional pen or pencil, as well
            as a digital pen compatible with devices.

            Users enjoyed how it was a compact and usable everyday solution.
            They thought the summaries would be usefulness in supplementing
            lecture content. The varying levels of synthesis could help
            &ldquo;pinpoint what I need to hear while studying.&rdquo; One user
            expressed that they were a visual learner and hearing the summary
            would be difficult to understand, which is something I would explore
            further with this project.

            Having such a broad HMW statement was daunting at first, but I
            realized the importance of strong user research to narrow the scope.
            I wish I had established goals for my user research before diving
            deep into it and had spent more time developing a cleaner design.
