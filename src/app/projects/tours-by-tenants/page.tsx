            Finding off-campus housing can be one of the most stressful and
            time-consuming tasks for college students. Students often face
            numerous challenges that make the process feel overwhelming. As
            students ourselves, my team in the Human-Centered Design Decal
            sought out to understand the issue further.
            <br />
            <br />
            We developed Tours by Tenants, an innovative housing search app that
            simplifies the process, helping users efficiently discover and
            secure their next home.

              <strong>Tours by Tenants (TT)</strong> allows users to view tours
              of housing units provided by other current or previous residents.
              This reduces the need for students to tour every housing option by
              offering real photos and videos, saving time in the search.

              Similar to other home rental sites, there is a map view, options
              to view floor plans and virtual tours, filter by amenities, and
              reviews. After initial user testing, I added an option to{" "}
              <strong>message</strong> current or previous tenants and
              landlords. The goal of this project was to make the housing search
              process as <strong>stress-free for college students</strong> as
              possible, streamlining the journey to save time by making a{" "}

          From speaking with 11 students through user interviews, we confirmed
          that finding off-campus housing was a commen struggle. From a user
          survey we conducted with 16 participants, 43.8% of them began
          searching for housing 6+ months in advance and 36.6% toured at least 4
          different potential spots.

          Through affinity our research insights, we focused on these three
          common pain point clusters. Students found the housing search process{" "}

            time-consuming, unorganized without a tracking method, and

          Seeing as there was a need for a centralizing platform for housing
          information, I thought a mobile app would be the best way to deliver
          the solutions. But before that, I needed to look at a commonly used

          After running <strong>5 more user tests</strong> with my lowfis , I
          found that users had difficulties navigating through the flows
          seamlessly. There was some confusion on the home page and users
          thought the UI was cluttered, especially on the apartment page. I did
          a full redesign of the 3 main components of this app: the home page,
          the listing page, and filtering screens.
